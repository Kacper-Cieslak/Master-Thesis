# Econometric analysis of the impact of monetary policy on inflation in Poland in the years 2004-2024
### Abstract

The master’s thesis aimed to analyze the impact of monetary policy on inflation in Poland between 2004 and 2024. The research problem was to examine the significance of central bank instruments’ influence on the price index. The research hypothesis assumed that the central bank significantly affected inflation through interest rates.

The theoretical part of the thesis covered the essence and theories of money as well as monetary policy. The study also presented statistics on macroeconomic conditions and monetary policy. An attempt was made to answer whether monetary policy was effective and whether actions taken during the COVID-19 pandemic could be classified as justified.

To verify the research hypothesis, a VAR model was developed, which simply reflected the monetary transmission mechanism. The study demonstrated that the reference rate and the EUR/PLN exchange rate had a significant impact on the CPI inflation rate in 2004–2024.
