## This analysis uses monthly time series data from 2004-2024, i.e. 252 observations. The econometric analysis was designed to answer the question of whether monetary policy influenced inflation in the years analyzed. Monetary policy in this chapter was understood as the main instrument of the National Bank of Poland, i.e., interest rates. Specifically, the data used the reference rate.

## The paper presents the monetary transmission channels in detail, but the entire mechanism can be simplified to the interest rate channel, the exchange rate channel, and the expectations channel. The data set includes a variable with the EUR/PLN exchange rate, which is intended to reflect the exchange rate channel. The variable for inflation is the CPI in relation to the same month a year earlier.

## The dummy variable was included to account for the COVID-19 pandemic, taking a value of 1 from March 2020 to November 2021 to capture the period of unprecedented monetary policy. During this time, interest rates were lowered despite rising inflation, which contradicts standard economic theory. This approach helps the model to effectively estimate the relationships between variables during periods without major external shocks, as also suggested in reports by the European Central Bank.

All variables are presented in the charts and are discussed in the 3 chapter in the Master's thesis.
